1)	Yes.
The fractional part plays role in defining the precision of a number. 
Number precision is defined as the maximum number of digits/bits present in a number. The mantissa/significand is composed of an implicit (meaning no need to store it) leading bit (left of radix point) and the fraction bits (to the right of radix point).
For example, we have a number which is represented as
1.121 * 10^3(1101). Now,
Mantissa - 1.121 
implicit leading bit - 1 
fraction bits - .121
Precision - 4 (containing 4 bits i.e. one leading bit and three fraction bits). 
Precision is important to avoid loss of information.


	2) For binary numbers, in single precision floating point, we generally represent a number as (-1)^s*1.m*(2)^e  so, this number with the leading 1 in the mantissa i.e. 1.m is called a normalized number.  The minimum being say, (-1)^s*1.m*(2)^emin.
So, a subnormal number is a number which are smaller than this which can be represented, but without a leading 1 in the mantissa.
 These numbers are represented as  (-1)^s*0.m*(2)^e. Here, the precision decreases as the number of leading zeroes increase in the mantissa.

< Normal Numbers >| < Subnormals > | < Subnormals > | < Normal Numbers >
                       
     (-1)*1.m*(2)^emin              0             1*1.m*(2)^emin

3)The first two methods defined by IEEE round to the nearest value and the remaining 3 methods are called direct rounding.
